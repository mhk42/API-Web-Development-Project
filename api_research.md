<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Explain what data you'll be using from the API and how you plan to use it in the project</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I am using the API to gather movie’s titles, and actor names. Using<br>this information, the user can favorite their favorite movies. They can also use<br>this information to create a list of movies that they have already watched,<br>the list could be called “Already Watched”. They can also add these movies<br>to a different list called “Plan to Watch”. The entire purpose of this<br>is to create personalized lists where you can put your favorite movies and<br>actors, movies you have already completed, and plan to watch in the future.<br>It is basically to keep track of movies you have watched/plan to watch<br>and I might include a feature where the user can rate the movies<br>they have previously watched. Other lists can also be added such as a<br>list to showcase the user’s top 10 movies or actors. I need to<br>use a route or endpoint that provides access to a list of movies<br>and actors. It will primarily revolve around the GET method that allows the<br>user to search the movie title either by name or ID like “/titles/search/title/{title},”<br>or /titles/search/keyword/{keyword},” and some similar routes for the actors.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> API Info</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The API’s Basic plan offers 500,000 requests per month. This is the quota<br>for the number of requests you can make to the API in a<br>month. The API also has a rate limit at 1,000 requests per hour.<br>The API’s description doesn&#39;t mention anything about refreshing.<br></p><br></td></tr>
